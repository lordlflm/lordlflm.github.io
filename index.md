Hi, I'm Thomas and this is my portfolio. 

I'm currently looking for an intership for summer 2025. Feel free to contact me for master research or job opportunities as well.

## About me
I'm a motivated undergraduate Computer Science student at University of Quebec in Montreal, and I'm eager to use this motivation, my technical skills as well as my natural soft skills to contribute in advancing research and solving meaningful problems.

I'm passionate about a variety of activities, including sports like hockey, biking, snowboarding, and sailing. I also love traveling, meeting new people and capturing moments through photography. In addition, I have a deep appreciation for cinema and music, which are a big part of my life.

## Projects
### MosaicLab
MosaicLab is desktop app to help [Linum](https://linum.info.uqam.ca/) researchers vizualize large brain images interactively. This project was built with a team, using the Qt framework in conjunction with Python, for my INM5151 class.

### OP.GG Clone
A clone of the popular League of Legends statistics provider [op.gg](https://www.op.gg/). It is also a 3rd rewrite of an app I previously built using Java and JavaFX, but this time, using technologies such as Tauri, Svelte, Rust and Typescript.

### Chad-GPT Discord Bot
Chad-GPT has nothing to do with AI nor chatbots (well maybe a little), it's just a funny name. It's a Discord Bot which I built to enable organizing Capture The Flags (CTF) weekly challenges on my discord server. Made with Python, Selenium and Docker.

### OS-Checker
A very small CLI program for comparing a program's text output to the content of a file. Was meant to replicate the `assert-line` feature of the bats testing suite and was used to validate school programming assignments. Made using Rust.
